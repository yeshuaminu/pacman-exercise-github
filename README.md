# PacMan Exercise
Factory for PacMen! Create as many PacMen as you please with the "Add PacMan" button. Press "Start Game" to have the PacMen you created interact with the walls of the webpage around them. Watch them bounce and chomp away, sometimes into each other!
## How to Run

## Roadmap of future improvements
Next steps for future rollouts include "pellets" for the PacMen to "eat up". Whichever PacMan eats up all the "pellets" wins the game!
